Say you want true love
And true love
I'll give to you
Say you want my money
Like a fool
I'll give it too

All that you ask
It may be hard to do
Just tell me darling
Oh, I think I'll do it for you

Say you want someone
Someone to love and care
Oh, I want you to know
My life is yours to share

Just as sure
As the skies are blue
Just tell me darling
I'll do it for you

Say you want someone
Someone to love and care
Oh, I want you to know
My life is yours to share

Just as sure
As the skies are blue
Just tell me darling
I'll do it for you
I'll do it for you
I'll do it for you
