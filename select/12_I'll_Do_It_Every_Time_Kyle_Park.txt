Well I called you on the phone to tell you who I love
And if you won't be mine
Then I'm hanging up, I won't call no more
But I'll do it every time

Oh, well, I'll do it every time
But I'm gentle and I'm not too rough
When I feel the touch of your wonderful love
I just can't get enough
Well, I ask you for a date, a little bitty date
And say no later than nine
Then I promise not to say, please don't go yet
But I'll do it every time

Well I begged and I begged for one little kiss
One little kiss would be fine
Then I tell you that I'll go, I won't take no more
But I'll do it every time

Oh, well, I'll do it, every time
But I'm gentle and I'm not too rough
When I feel the touch, of your wonderful love
I just can't get enough
Well, I ask you for a date, a little bitty date
And say no later than nine
Then I promise not to say, please don't go yet
But I'll do it every time

Oh, well, I'll do it, every time
But I'm gentle and I'm not too rough
When I feel the touch, of your wonderful love
I just can't get enough
Well, I ask you for a date, a little bitty date
And say no later than nine
Then I promise not to say, please don't go yet
But I'll do it every time
Every time
